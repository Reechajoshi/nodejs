# Quick start

## Node.js

    npm install bluebird

Then:

```js
var Promise = require("bluebird");
```

## Browsers

There are many ways to use bluebird in browsers:

- Direct downloads
    - Full build [bluebird.js](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/bluebird/latest/bluebird.js)
    - Full build minified [bluebird.min.js](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/bluebird/latest/bluebird.min.js)
- You may use browserify on the main export
- You may use the [bower](http://bower.io) package.

When using script tags the global variables `Promise` and `P` (alias for `Promise`) become available.

A [minimal bluebird browser build](#custom-builds) is &asymp;38.92KB minified*, 11.65KB gzipped and has no external dependencies.

*Google Closure Compiler using Simple.

#### Browser support

Browsers that [implement ECMA-262, edition 3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecmascript#Implementations) and later are supported.

[![Selenium Test Status](https://saucelabs.com/browser-matrix/petka_antonov.svg)](https://saucelabs.com/u/petka_antonov)

**Note** that in ECMA-262, edition 3 (IE7, IE8 etc.) it is not possible to use methods that have keyword names like `.catch` and `.finally`. The [API documentation](API.md) always lists a compatible alternative name that you can use if you need to support these browsers. For example `.catch` is replaced with `.caught` and `.finally` with `.lastly`.

Also, [long stack trace](API.md#promiselongstacktraces---void) support is only available in Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer 10+.

After quick start, see [API Reference and examples](API.md)

# What are promises and why should I use them?

You should use promises to turn this:

```js
fs.readFile("file.json", function(err, val) {
    if( err ) {
        console.error("unable to read file");
    }
    else {
        try {
            val = JSON.parse(val);
            console.log(val.success);
        }
        catch( e ) {
            console.error("invalid json in file");
        }
    }
});
```

Into this:

```js
fs.readFileAsync("file.json").then(JSON.parse).then(function(val) {
    console.log(val.success);
})
.catch(SyntaxError, function(e) {
    console.error("invalid json in file");
})
.catch(function(e) {
    console.error("unable to read file")
});
```

*If you are wondering "there is no `readFileAsync` method on `fs` that returns a promise", see [promisification](API.md#promisification)*

Actually you might notice the latter has a lot in common with code that would do the same using synchronous I/O:

```js
try {
    var val = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync("file.json"));
    console.log(val.success);
}
//Syntax actually not supported in JS but drives the point
catch(SyntaxError e) {
    console.error("invalid json in file");
}
catch(Error e) {
    console.error("unable to read file")
}
```

And that is the point - being able to have something that is a lot like `return` and `throw` in synchronous code.

You can also use promises to improve code that was written with callback helpers:


```js
//Copyright Plato http://stackoverflow.com/a/19385911/995876
//CC BY-SA 2.5
mapSeries(URLs, function (URL, done) {
    var options = {};
    needle.get(URL, options, function (error, response, body) {
        if (error) {
            return done(error)
        }
        try {
            var ret = JSON.parse(body);
            return done(null, ret);
        }
        catch (e) {
            done(e);
        }
    });
}, function (err, results) {
    if (err) {
        console.log(err)
    } else {
        console.log('All Needle requests successful');
        // results is a 1 to 1 mapping in order of URLs > needle.body
        processAndSaveAllInDB(results, function (err) {
            if (err) {
                return done(err)
            }
            console.log('All Needle requests saved');
            done(null);
        });
    }
});
```

Is more pleasing to the eye when done with promises:

```js
Promise.promisifyAll(needle);
var options = {};

var current = Promise.resolve();
Promise.map(URLs, function(URL) {
    current = current.then(function () {
        return needle.getAsync(URL, options);
    });
    return current;
}).map(function(responseAndBody){
    return JSON.parse(responseAndBody[1]);
}).then(function (results) {
    return processAndSaveAllInDB(results);
}).then(function(){
    console.log('All Needle requests saved');
}).catch(function (e) {
    console.log(e);
});
```

Also promises don't just give you correspondences for synchronous features but can also be used as limited event emitters or callback aggregators.

# Questions and issues

If you find a bug in bluebird or have a feature request, file an issue in the [github issue tracker](https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird/issues). Anything else, such as questions for help in using the library, should be posted in [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/bluebird) under tags `promise` and `bluebird`.

# Error handling

This is a problem every promise library needs to handle in some way. Unhandled rejections/exceptions don't really have a good agreed-on asynchronous correspondence. The problem is that it is impossible to predict the future and know if a rejected promise will eventually be handled.

There are two common pragmatic attempts at solving the problem that promise libraries do.

The more popular one is to have the user explicitly communicate that they are done and any unhandled rejections should be thrown, like so:

```js
download().then(...).then(...).done();
```

For handling this problem, in my opinion, this is completely unacceptable and pointless. The user must remember to explicitly call `.done` and that cannot be justified when the problem is forgetting to create an error handler in the first place.

The second approach, which is what bluebird by default takes, is to call a registered handler if a rejection is unhandled by the start of a second turn. The default handler is to write the stack trace to `stderr` or `console.error` in browsers. This is close to what happens with synchronous code - your code doesn't work as expected and you open console and see a stack trace. Nice.

Of course this is not perfect, if your code for some reason needs to swoop in and attach error handler to some promise after the promise has been hanging around a while then you will see annoying messages. In that case you can use the `.done()` method to signal that any hanging exceptions should be thrown.

If you want to override the default handler for these possibly unhandled rejections, you can pass yours like so:

```js
Promise.onPossiblyUnhandledRejection(function(error){
    throw error;
});
```

If you want to also enable long stack traces, call:

```js
Promise.longStackTraces();
```

right after the library is loaded.

In node.js use the environment flag `BLUEBIRD_DEBUG`:

```
BLUEBIRD_DEBUG=1 node server.js
```

to enable long stack traces in all instances of bluebird.

Long stack traces cannot be disabled after being enabled, and cannot be enabled after promises have already been created. Long stack traces imply a substantial performance penalty, even after using every trick to optimize them.

Long stack traces are enabled by default in the debug build.

#### Expected and unexpected errors

A practical problem with Promises/A+ is that it models Javascript `try-catch` too closely for its own good. Therefore by default promises inherit `try-catch` warts such as the inability to specify the error types that the catch block is eligible for. It is an anti-pattern in every other language to use catch-all handlers because they swallow exceptions that you might not know about.

Now, Javascript does have a perfectly fine and working way of creating error type hierarchies. It is still quite awkward to use them with the built-in `try-catch` however:

```js
try {
    //code
}
catch(e) {
    if( e instanceof WhatIWantError) {
        //handle
    }
    else {
        throw e;
    }
}
```

Without such checking, unexpected errors would be silently swallowed. However, with promises, bluebird brings the future (hopefully) here now and extends the `.catch` to [accept potential error type eligibility](API.md#catchfunction-errorclass-function-handler---promise).

For instance here it is expected that some evil or incompetent entity will try to crash our server from `SyntaxError` by providing syntactically invalid JSON:

```js
getJSONFromSomewhere().then(function(jsonString) {
    return JSON.parse(jsonString);
}).then(function(object) {
    console.log("it was valid json: ", object);
}).catch(SyntaxError, function(e){
    console.log("don't be evil");
});
```

Here any kind of unexpected error will automatically reported on `stderr` along with a stack trace because we only register a handler for the expected `SyntaxError`.

Ok, so, that's pretty neat. But actually not many libraries define error types and it is in fact a complete ghetto out there with ad hoc strings being attached as some arbitrary property name like `.name`, `.type`, `.code`, not having any property at all or even throwing strings as errors and so on. So how can we still listen for expected errors?

Bluebird defines a special error type `OperationalError` (you can get a reference from `Promise.OperationalError`). This type of error is given as rejection reason by promisified methods when
their underlying library gives an untyped, but expected error. Primitives such as strings, and error objects that are directly created like `new Error("database didn't respond")` are considered untyped.

Example of such library is the node core library `fs`. So if we promisify it, we can catch just the errors we want pretty easily and have programmer errors be redirected to unhandled rejection handler so that we notice them:

```js
//Read more about promisification in the API Reference:
//API.md
var fs = Promise.promisifyAll(require("fs"));

fs.readFileAsync("myfile.json").then(JSON.parse).then(function (json) {
    console.log("Successful json")
}).catch(SyntaxError, function (e) {
    console.error("file contains invalid json");
}).catch(Promise.OperationalError, function (e) {
    console.error("unable to read file, because: ", e.message);
});
```

The last `catch` handler is only invoked when the `fs` module explicitly used the `err` argument convention of async callbacks to inform of an expected error. The `OperationalError` instance will contain the original error in its `.cause` property but it does have a direct copy of the `.message` and `.stack` too. In this code any unexpected error - be it in our code or the `fs` module - would not be caught by these handlers and therefore not swallowed.

Since a `catch` handler typed to `Promise.OperationalError` is expected to be used very often, it has a neat shorthand:

```js
.error(function (e) {
    console.error("unable to read file, because: ", e.message);
});
```

See [API documentation for `.error()`](API.md#error-rejectedhandler----promise)

Finally, Bluebird also supports predicate-based filters. If you pass a
predicate function instead of an error type, the predicate will receive
the error as an argument. The return result will be used to determine whether
the error handler should be called.

Predicates should allow for very fine grained control over caught errors:
pattern matching, error typesets with set operations and many other techniques
can be implemented on top of them.

Example of using a predicate-based filter:

```js
var Promise = require("bluebird");
var request = Promise.promisify(require("request"));

function clientError(e) {
    return e.code >= 400 && e.code < 500;
}

request("http://www.google.com").then(function(contents){
    console.log(contents);
}).catch(clientError, function(e){
   //A client error like 400 Bad Request happened
});
```

**Danger:** The JavaScript language allows throwing primitive values like strings. Throwing primitives can lead to worse or no stack traces. Primitives [are not exceptions](http://www.devthought.com/2011/12/22/a-string-is-not-an-error/). You should consider always throwing Error objects when handling exceptions.

#### How do long stack traces differ from e.g. Q?

Bluebird attempts to have more elaborate traces. Consider:

```js
Error.stackTraceLimit = 25;
Q.longStackSupport = true;
Q().then(function outer() {
    return Q().then(function inner() {
        return Q().then(function evenMoreInner() {
            a.b.c.d();
        }).catch(function catcher(e){
            console.error(e.stack);
        });
    })
});
```

You will see

    ReferenceError: a is not defined
        at evenMoreInner (<anonymous>:7:13
